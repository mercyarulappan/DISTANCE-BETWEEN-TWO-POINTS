# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:

To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:

### Step 1: 
Using import math function,do the calculations.
### Step 2: 
Assign the values of point 1 and point 2 whose distance is to be calculated.
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
using the print function, display the distance between the two points.
### Step 5: 
using the print function, display the distance between the two points.

### PROGRAM:
  
```

import math as ns
l1= [4,2]
l2= [10,6]
d=ns.sqrt(((l2[0]-l1[0])**2)+((l2[1]-l1[1])**2))
print(f"{d:.2f}")
```

### OUTPUT:
